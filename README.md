## Rust Programming Language tutorial

To create a new project, with a github repository set to the *main* branch:

* create the new, desired repo on github
* clone the repo locally
* run `cargo init [repo name]`

The new repository will be initialized for Rust, using the git structure defined when the repository was created and subsequently cloned.

*note: .gitignore is handled by Cargo, where a new repo only needs to include the README and the license*
